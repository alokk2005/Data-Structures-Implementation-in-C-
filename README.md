# 📘 Data Structures Implementation in C++

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the **implementation of core Data Structures using C++**.  
All data structures are implemented **from scratch without using STL containers**, helping to understand internal working, memory management, and algorithm efficiency.

The project is **menu-driven**, making it easy to use and ideal for **learning, practical exams, and interviews**.

## ⏱️ Time Complexity Analysis
| Data Structure | Operation | Time Complexity |
|---------------|----------|----------------|
| Linked List | Insert / Delete | O(n) |
| Stack | Push / Pop | O(1) |
| Queue | Enqueue / Dequeue | O(1) |
| BST | Search / Insert | O(log n) (Average) |
