📘 Data Structures Implementation in C++
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of core Data Structures using C++.
All data structures are implemented from scratch without using STL containers, helping to understand internal working, memory management, and algorithm efficiency.

The project is menu-driven, making it easy to use and ideal for learning, practical exams, and interviews.

🧠 Data Structures Implemented

Linked List

Insert

Delete

Display

⚙️ Technologies Used

Programming Language: C++

Compiler: GCC

IDE: VS Code / CodeBlocks

Platform: Windows / Linux

🖥️ How to Run the Project

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/alokk2005/Data-Structures-Implementation-in-Cpp.git


Navigate to the project folder:

cd Data-Structures-Implementation-in-Cpp


Compile the program:

g++ main.cpp -o dsa


Run the program:

./dsa

📋 Menu Structure
1. Linked List
2. Stack
3. Queue
4. Binary Search Tree
5. Exit


Each option further provides sub-menus for operations like insert, delete, push, pop, etc.

⏱️ Time Complexity Analysis
Data Structure	Operation	Time Complexity
Linked List	Insert / Delete	O(n)
Stack	Push / Pop	O(1)
Queue	Enqueue / Dequeue	O(1)
BST	Search / Insert	O(log n) (Average)
